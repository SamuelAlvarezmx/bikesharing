# BikeSharing

## Overview

In this proyect the focus was to learn how does the Citi bike runs in NY city. With data extracted we looked on number of trips, how long a trip can last, how were the clients that used the bikes and the impact it may have recreate a business similar to it in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

To begin the presentation it is important to mention that in NYC there is a population around 8 million people that live in the city. Compared to 215k people that live in Des Mois Iowa. Accordingly to the bikesID number NYC has 14k bikes in the CitiBike system. Lets start our analysis in how the customers are distributed. A Story in Tableu was ellaborated to analyze the data and is available in the next link. [link to Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samuel6259/viz/citi_bikes_story/Story1?publish=yes)

### Customers Profile

* There are two types of customers the ones that are subscribed to Citi's bike system and the ones that use them occassionally that are labeled as customer. There is still almost a 5th of the users that we could attract to buy a subscription into the system becoming this an area of opportunity to generate more sales.

* Also we can see that the bikes are used mored by men, women apparently are less attracted to this service and it could be helpful to look into creating an environment in which women also feel invited to use this type of transportation.

* Finally in the last graph we can see represented this both results, Male users do more trips in bikes than women and also the subscribers are using more the bikes than regular customers, the most affluenced days apparentlu are in the weekends where people have more spare time to use the bikes. This could be an area of opportunity to target people that commit to work to use this type of transportation.

### Pick up and Drop off bike areas

In the below images we can have an idea on how bikes are moved around the city. it is noticeable that the areas where the bikes are used are very centric. 

Therefore in NYC it is important to take action in always having more bikes in this centric areas to give the service to the customers.

<img width="1003" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 22 23 18" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104656920/194461320-8314ec17-2c99-42fc-ac82-b28e494872af.png">


### Active hours

<img width="1040" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 22 29 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104656920/194462062-a026e51e-1d85-49c7-855c-081bf3bbcf55.png">

Here we can see the most active hours of bike riding. The first impression is that the bikes are used in the mornigs and evenings during weekdays, this could represent that people actually are using the bikes to commit to their work, however on Saturday and Sundays the bike riding looks even at almost all hours except in the sleeping hours, however not as much activity as the peaks in the weekdays.

### Trip Duration

<img width="849" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-06 at 22 34 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104656920/194462567-9550a436-ea95-4ed4-a278-ea52d084bf95.png">

The majority of rides finish around the half hour of use, therefore bikes are quick to grab and go to the places the clients need to be in short period of time.

### Bike maintenance anaysis

A lot of people using bikes means a need to plan a good maintenance schedule. In the following graphs we can see that there are some bikes(represented by each tile of the blue graph) that have more rides than others. it is necessary to track this bikes and give them the maintenance check ups. Also, with the red graph we can see that for this system the best plan could be to schedule this check ups or work between 1 am and 5 am that are the lowest riding hours.

## Summary

* After reviewing NYC data it looks very great idea having this type of system, for example, for more than 2 million people using the bike sytem there is only 14k bikes. It is highly profitable considering that almost the two million peoples are subscribers.

* People donÂ´t use the bikes for more than 30 minutes therefore we do not have to worry about not having bikes ready for different users and are an easy way of transportation.

* It is important to put the stations in centric places beacuse as in NYC people will use bikes to go around places not too far away, therefore the bike stations could be less and more close together for giving maintenance to the bikes faster and we need to be aware that on early hours it will be the best moment to give this maintenance.

### Further analysis

There are two analysis that I propose to get more info from this data set and are the following:

1. Birth Date vs Customer Type: This analysis will shine light to see if there is any relevance on age to be a subscriber or a regular customer.

2. Bike ID and Starting locations to see if there is any correlation in the trips that a bike has made with the location in which this bike is.
